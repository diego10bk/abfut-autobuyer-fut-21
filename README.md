Instruction 

* Login:

You use the familar function on web-app or companion app to login. Than you have to go to the tab "AUTO" (4th on the bottom bar)

*Add Card

The cards can be added from the Auto tab on the web-app. Just enter a name, choose the appropriate options. Than go to bottom of the list set the prices (buy & sell). you should refer to the price of the card on futbin.com

Sell Price: Set the price you want to sell. Leaving = 0 or empty if you dont want to sell the card.
Buy Price: Set this price the tool will go find the Card with buy now price is lower than this price.
Bid Price: Set this price tool will automatically bid for cards whose bid price is smaller than the number you set. App only bid for auction cards with less than 2 minutes remaining.
You should only have a Buy or Bid price, and you shouldn't set both. If you set both, you should prioritize the Buy price.
Rating is an optional, the app only has rating>= this number.
* Scan Setting configurations

Auto update price: The App will automatically find the BIN price on the market at that time to set the price. Pricing has 4 policies: Fastsell ~ Expected to sell after 5 minutes (~ BIN) followed by 15p, 30p. * Note that this is only a forecast at that time, if the price of the card is falling too fast, it will be sold lower. Option Limit is the default sell of the webapp ie start is min of Range and Buy now is max of Range => this is basically for other users to bid so after 1 hour to sell and the price depends on Bid
Auto sell won player: Used for the card that you are setting autobidder (with bid price). Because it is Bid, when the auction is completed, we know whether to buy and declare whether or not. App does not know this, so you have to set Option ON, which means that the app will automatically earn in your transfer list the place to win Bid is to sell the previous card you won.
max purchases per player: corresponding to the card you have added the app will buy up to this number and then remove that card from the Snipe list
Scanning time: Running time
Buy only to build team: If this option is ON, even if you have set the price of Sell app, it will not automatically sell. The idea is that you buy it to keep it in the team or sell it later.
Auto sell won player: Used for the card that you are setting autobidder (with bid price). Because it is Bid, when the auction is completed, we know whether to buy and declare whether or not. App does not know this, so you have to set Option ON, which means that the app will automatically earn in your transfer list the place to win Bid is to sell the previous card you won.
Scan speed: There are 3 levels to choose from. If you buy fast, you can leave Fast, but fast for too long, the risk of being banned by EA is temporarily or busy verify
* Scanning

When scanning you can check the details of how the app runs through the console log.
If the log is not running, start again.
You can ON-OFF the cards, or change the price, correct from autobuy to bid or vice versa when posting.
The web app can still be used while running but absolutely do not use the market search function because the app is automatically here if you change it, it may cause an error.
* Other note

If you do not know the price, you should use auto update price. each 10 round search the price will updated.
When the price fluctuates, this function is ineffective, so to reduce the risk with this function ON, cards with les than 10p remaining will not be purchased. Up to 3 cards per purchase. Cards whose price falls more than 20% will be removed.
